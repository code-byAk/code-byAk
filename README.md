Hello there!
I am Arnab Karmakar, under my coding alias of "CODEBYAK", here into the world of GIT.
Studying in Jadavpur University in a branch of not my personal choice, coding gives me the only solace I require!
Lets hope we can work together into creating something worthwhile and learn all the more in the process!

Ciao.
